# Schema Design

## Overview

With thousands of different agencies across the United States, the information to be loaded into our central database comes in wildly different formats. A requirement for handling and presentation is to standardize it across federal, state, and municipal and university levels into one cohesive, easy-to-understand package. One problem for the scrapers is each agency delivers different amounts of data back to us to be digested.

## Problem

For City Protect Incident Reports, we get a beautiful JSON response of everything that we need to know about the agency:

```text
{
                "id": "5ce2bd6d3934cc0011eda5f2",
                "crapiId": "111439",
                "name": "Aransas County Sheriffs Office",
                "center": {
                    "coordinates": [
                        -97.053961,
                        28.025965
                    ],
                    "_id": "5ee9edad0e5b2f0013184fcb",
                    "type": "Point"
                },
                "cameraPinLat": 28.2718,
                "cameraPinLng": -97.1242,
                "updatedAt": "2021-04-13T05:11:27.000Z",
                "city": "Rockport",
                "state": "TX",
                "zip": "78382",
                "type": "Sheriff Dept",
                "email": null,
                "county": null,
                "address1": null,
                "address2": null,
                "customerId": "aransascounty.org",
                "isSandboxAgency": false,
                "sandboxAgencyName": null,
                "reports": [],
                "features": [
                    "FORMS_MANAGEMENT",
                    "TIP_SUBMIT_BASIC_CONFIGURATION",
                    "AGENCY_MAP",
                    "TIPPING",
                    "AGENCY_MAP_INCIDENTS",
                    "AGENCY_MAP_SEXOFFENDERS",
                    "AGENCY_PAGE",
                    "BULLETIN",
                    "CAMERA_REGISTRATION"
                ],
                "agencyBadgeUrl": "",
                "agencyName": "ARANSAS COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE",
                "customTippingUrl": "",
                "agencyPathName": "a1f9a015-6e65-4366-a1f7-48e196f7d4e3",
                "bulkDownload": false,
                "tippingEnabled": false,
                "_id": "5ce2bd6d3934cc0011eda5f2"
            }
```

In this case, we know everything we need to ensure we have a record in the `datasets` table to connect our imported incident reports to. Next, we just need to ensure the columns from the data match our columns in the appropriate table, link the foreign keys and we are done!

Another example would be in the scrapers repo, /USA/CA/sacramento\_county/colleges/LosRiosComm found [here](https://github.com/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/PDAP-Scrapers/tree/main/USA/CA/sacramento_county/colleges/LosRiosComm). We know from the prefix that it is a college. But the data downloaded from the data source website is in PDF format which may be challenging to parse without reliance on OCR, and at most would just give us the name of the agency.

## Solution

The solution to the issue of agencies delivering wildly different amounts of information would be to create a standard `schema.json` file in the root of each scraper that provides all of the information required to understand what we are dealing with in both a machine-readable and human-readable format.

```text
{
    "agency_id": "",
    "agency_info":{
        "agency_name":"",
        "agency_coords":{"lat": "", "long":""},
        "state": "",
        "county":""
    },
    "data": [
        {
            "dataset_id": "",
            "url":"",
            "aggregation":"",
            "full_data_location":"/incident_reports",
            "source_type": 2,
            "data_type": 1,
            "format_type": 1,
            "mapping":[
            ]
        }
    ]

}
```

This is the proposed data solution. It can either be populated automatically by the scraper's main python file, or manually filled in if the data is not easily accessible via scraping.

This is a breakdown of the fields:

* **agency\_id**: id of the agency in the agencies table
* **agency\_info**: This provides more information about the agency. If the ID is listed above and you change any information here, it will be automatically updated in the database if the script is run again.
  * **`agency_name`**: name of the agency such as 'Gaston County Sheriff'
  * **`agency_coords`**: this will probably require you to search up on Google Maps. This is actually very important to ensure we pull the correct FIPS and municipal codes. Search the agency on google maps, and right click on the pin to grab the lat and long coordinates. It is okay if there are multiple districts, just grab the main district if so.
  * **`state`**: two-letter state code \('IN', 'CA'\)
  * **`county`**: county name in Title case \(first letter capitalized: 'Marion', 'Bristol Bay'\) \(leave blank if a state agency\)
  * **`city`**: city of the agency \(leave blank if a county or state agency\)
* **data**: There can be multiple types of data from each agency, so this is an enumerable way to point to the different types of data stored. Store each type in a different directory such as `/incident_reports` , `/booking_reports` .etc. 
  * **dataset\_id**: The ID from our list of datasets found [here](https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/pdap/datasets/data/master/datasets). If this is a new dataset not yet in our table, leave this blank and the ETL script will use the information in `dataset_information` to add a record and automatically add the ID to the schema.json file.
  * **url**: the url of the dataset used
  * **aggregation**: this is how the data is aggregated. use `federal`, `state`, `county`, `muncipal` or `university`
  * **source\_type**: use one of the values in the `id` column found in the source\_types table [here](https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/pdap/datasets/data/master/source_types)\*\*\*\*
  * **data\_type**: use one of the values in the `id` column found in the data\_types table [here](https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/pdap/datasets/data/master/data_types) \(such as `10` for `incident_reports` data\)
  * **format\_type**: use one of the values in the `id` column found in the format\_types table [here](https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/pdap/datasets/data/master/format_types) \(such as `2` for `cityprotect` data\)
  * **full\_data\_location**: the location of all the data from the scraper. It will most likely just be in the `/data` directory in the same folder after the scraper has ran
  * **mapping**: based off of your `data_type`, the data will be stored in a different table with different columns. This section is how your data maps to the columns in the database such as for `"table_col": "data_col"`

## Usage

With the `schema.json` file populated, we will have a library stored in `/common/etl` that will be able to use all of this information to translate the data with ease and add/locate/update the main dataset or agency to keep it in sync if anything changes. The schema file also points exactly where the output files are located, and tells the ETL library exactly how to map the files in terms of columns and the appropriate agency + dataset.
